Release date 08 MAY 2025
SDEV 248

Project was designed for Advanced Simulation and Game Design to be a 3-deminsional billiards simulation using the functionality of Godot Game Engine (v 4.4).

The SPACE bar is used to shoot the ball. The length of time the space bar is pressed determines the power of the shot.

WSAD Keys are used to move the cue in the x and z positions.
Additional functionality was added to lift and lower the cue in the y position using the Q and Z keys.

The rotation of the cue can be manipulated with the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT keys.

A reset for the cue was set on the X key.

*A cue ball reset is currently not functioning.
